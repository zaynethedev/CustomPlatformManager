### Custom Platform Manager is a gameplay-based mod made for the VR game Gorilla Tag. It summons a holdable tablet (grab using the grip button on your controllers) that gives the player the options to change the color, shape, size and type of platforms. Hold grip on either hand to summon a platform.
